						<h4> #SWIRLY </h4>
						<p>  I love to share with you guys how.... I love ICE CREAM. Its my stress reliever 
							and I'm always happy everytime I eat ice cream.I've discovered this ice cream
							parlor weeks ago. We're on our way home when I saw this stall
							but Its not open yet, but I'm facinated with the interior of it. I like how a small space transformed
							into a aesthetic stall. At first glance I thought its just a stall of whatsoever but as days goes by,
							that particular stall became extravagant and pleasing in the eyes of every people passing by. 
						</p>
						<p>	I'm so excited when I saw that they are already open and to my horror its an Ice cream parlor!!!
							and on its opening day I immediately drop by and
							bought ice cream for myself. I ordered the Caramel ice cream with graham ang chocolate as its toppings.
							At my first bite, my heart really flutters because it is really yummy
							and I love the texture of their ice cream compare to the typical ice
							cream. Swirly's rolled ice cream is really a must try product. Ciao!

						<h4> #CRAVING SATISFIED </h4>
						<p> After my college entrance examination, I went to Grumpy Joe with Stefano 
							to have some brunch because I'm already hungry and also 
							exhausted because the test is so hard. Its not my first time dining here,
							but I must say that their dishes is timeless. I ordered my favorite meal and it is the
							Combo B that consist of one buffalo wings,one serving of fries, a pizza and
							a delicious spaghetti.This combo will surely get your stomach satisfied and full.
							The flavors of each components really works together.I really love their buffalo wings
							because it has a balance taste that is really suited in the tongue. I also love how
							the spaghetti tasted because its not too sweet and it is not also too salty.
							We also ordered the Aloha 5 cheeze pizza because it is
							really my favorite in their list of dishes. 
						</p>
						<p>	This resto has a welcoming aura which is really good and their crew is also
							accomodating and they always smile whenever a costumer will approach them.
							I love how they treat their costumers and they really welcomes you as their costumer.
						</p>
						<p> Whenever I'm stressed I tend to eat a lot. Stress eating makes me fat but thats
							okay because whenever I eat my favorite foods, it makes me happy, yeah its weird
							but thats the truth and I love myself for being who I'am. Grumpy Joe really makes me happy.Ciao!

					<h4> #CHANGE FOR THE BETTER </h4>
						<p> Hey Guys!!! I decided to repaint my room. My previous room paint is color pink and its too girly
							for me thats why I decided to chose what's the best color for my room and also what's best for
							my age. I picked a light gray tone because this kind of color is flexible especially in decorations.
							This is a tip from me, if you decided also to repaint your room choose a color that really suited for you
							and pick a color that is suited for all types of design. I also decided to repaint my bed and cabinet and 
							I had so much fun with this change I did.
						</p>
						<p>	Making change in youself is not bad. Sometimes we need to change for us to grow. We need to change for us 
							to be better. That is how life goes. There's no such thing as constant in this world. We should always
							remember that.Ciao!

						<h4> #MICELLAIR MAGIC </h4>
						<p> This product has magic. I want to share with you guys this review because I can really tell
							that it is really effective. I've discovered this through a friend of mine. At first I dont want 
							to use it because I'm not sure if it is really effective and suited for my skin type but
							when I tried it and thats it, I've been using this for the couple of months now and I must say
							it really gives me a glowing skin and it became smoother than before.
							This toner is really good to those who always wear make up. This 
							toner has Magnolia Bark Extract that help reduce the chance of acne and clogging of pores. It is
							also pH-balanced, free of alcohol, paraben, fragrance,silicone and colorant free.Unlike other toners 
							this product really gives me the chance to clean also the sensitive part of my face which is my
							eye area. I have a very sensitive skin and this toner is really suited for me
							because it has organic chemicalsthat can really take care of my skin.
							Tips, before using this product you should wash your face first then after
							washing it, get the Micellair Toner and use cotton pads and gently
							wipe over your face and no rinsing required.
							Lastly, Go out and glow.Ciao!

							<h4> #ST. IVES APRICOT SCRUB </h4>
							<p> Hey everyone! so I want to share with you guys again about this another product
								that I'm using. This is the St. Ives Apricot Scrub, it is the number one  skin
								product in America because it has 100% narural walnut shell powder that deeply
								cleanses pores and it helps the skin to stop breakouts for a balanced and radiant
								skin. I've been using this since January, I've seen this product through youtuber, there
								are so many youtubers that really promotes this product that why I gave it a try.
								During the month of January I had pimple breakouts and to may surprise after continuously using
								this product it really lightens my pimple marks. I've also notice that every after I scrub
								my face with this product it really gives my a fresh feeling and its like it really 
								cleanses my skin and remove the dead cells in it. Tips, use this every after using the green tea scrub
								of the same brand. Use also the Micelliar toner after using this scrub and put the St. Ives 
								moisturizer after to give your skin the care that it deserve. Ciao!

						<h4> #ST.IVES GREEN TEA SCRUB </h4>
						<p> Introducing my first ever skin care. Hi everyone! I want to share with you guys this product
							that really gives me a very glowing and clean skin. The St. Ives blackhead clearing Green Tea 
							Scrub. This scrub contains 100% natural exfoliants to unclog dirt and oil from pores for a 
							clear, radiant skin. It has an active ingredient called Salicylic Acid for Acne treatment.
							This ingredient is really important and useful because it helps the skin to manage 
							acne and it also helps to keep the skin clear of new blackheads and acne blemishes. I tried this product
							with the St. Ives Apricot Scrub and this two really works together. I've discovered it also through youtube.
							It is really suited for my sensitive skin and acne prone because that is what this product for.This
							product is also paraben free, so I've mention in my previous reviews that all the products in my skin care is
							paraben free, because other products in the market has paraben, this is a chemical that is really
							dangerous for the skin, thats why we should always check the products that we buy. Tips, use this product
							in removing your makeup and use this before using all your skin products. Ciao!
